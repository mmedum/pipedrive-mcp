# Claude Desktop's manifest names a command per PLATFORM and has no key
# for the architecture, and Linux ships both x64 and arm64. So this picks
# the binary and EXECS it: the server talks MCP over this process's
# stdio, and a shell left in the middle would own the pipes.
#
# The two names below are the packer's. `gates mcpb` reads them out of
# this file and fails if they are not what the packer stages, because
# nothing else can see them: a manifest never mentions this script's
# contents, so a renamed binary would pack cleanly, install cleanly, and
# fail for every Linux user with the message below.
