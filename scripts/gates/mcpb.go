// The bundle gate and the packer (§12, and the standard's §10b).
//
// They are two subcommands because the useful half needs no build. The
// checks below are REFERENTIAL — they ask whether the manifest's names
// are the names something stages — and the staged names are static, so
// they can run on every commit against the committed manifest. Only the
// packing waits for a release, where the binaries exist.
//
// A schema would not catch any of this. Every failure here produces a
// manifest that is well formed, packs, installs, and then does nothing:
// an entry point nobody staged, an override for a platform the bundle
// does not claim, a platform whose command is another platform's binary,
// a ${user_config.x} that was never declared, a launcher choosing
// between names the packer does not write. Those are facts about the
// archive rather than about the document.

// manifestPath is the committed manifest, which carries a placeholder
// version so a manifest in the tree cannot claim a stale one.

// refuses any other value and writes the real version through a JSON

// architecture and execs it.

//
// This list is the single source of the staged NAMES. The gate reads it
// without building anything, and the packer reads the same rows to find
// the files — so a manifest naming a file nobody stages is a fact about
// two files in this repository, found on the commit that wrote it.
